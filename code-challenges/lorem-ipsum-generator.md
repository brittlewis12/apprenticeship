### Apprentice Code Challenge - "Lorem Ipsum Generator"

##### Objective

Create a program that generates a certain amount of [lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) text given user defined constraints (e.g. "1 sentence", "2 paragraphs", "3 words"). The lorem ipsum output should be generated by the program itself, without the aid of an external API. 

##### Constraints

- Use Ruby as a language
- Adhere to object-oriented design principles
- The solution should exist as a public GitHub repository
- Make a github commit for each requirement

##### Requirements

Your program should provide for the following functionality:  

- Accept varying text length constraints from the user (e.g. "1 sentence", "2 paragraphs", "3 words").
- Return 

##### Examples


##### Areas we evaluate

- Simplicity/elegance of design (be prepared to discuss)
- Maintainability (clean, code that is easy to understand and change)
- Testing (we encourage [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec))
