### Apprentice Code Challenge - "Lorem Ipsum Generator"

##### Objective

Create a program that generates [lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) text given a user input of **number of words** and **seed text**.

##### Constraints

- Use Ruby or JavaScript as a language
- Adhere to object-oriented design principles
- The solution should exist as a public GitHub repository
- Use Github and [**make frequent commits**](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) as you progress through the requirements

##### Requirements

Your program should provide for the following functionality:

- Accept number of words requested
- Accept a list of words (space, comma, or new line separated) that will be the basis of the lorem ipsum text
- Return lorem ipsum sentences and paragraphs of varying length

##### Examples

    "coding javascript ruby programming Tim", 50 #=>

    "Ruby javascript programming ruby Tim coding. Programming javascript ruby programming Tim javascript programming ruby Tim. Coding ruby Tim javascript programming Tim. Tim javascript coding ruby javascript Tim ruby.

    Ruby programming Tim coding ruby programming javascript. Javascript coding ruby programming javascript ruby Tim javascript. Coding Tim programming javascript coding programming javascript."

##### Areas we evaluate

- Simplicity/elegance of design (be prepared to discuss)
- Maintainability (clean, code that is easy to understand and change)
- Testing (we encourage [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) or [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine))
