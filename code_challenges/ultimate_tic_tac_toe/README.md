### Apprentice Code Challenge - "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe"

##### Objective

Create a program that will never lose a game of tic-tac-toe against the moves of a human user.

##### Constraints

- Use Ruby or JavaScript as a language
- Adhere to object-oriented design principles
- Use a standard 3x3 tic-tac-toe board
- The solution should exist as a public GitHub repository
- Use Github and [**make frequent commits**](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) as you progress through the requirements

##### Requirements

Your program should provide the following functionality:

- A user or program can make the first move
- A user can input what square they would like to make a move on
- A user should be able to see the state of the board
- A game should always end in a victory for the program or tie

##### Areas we evaluate

- Simplicity/elegance of design (be prepared to discuss)
- Maintainability (clean, code that is easy to understand and change)
- Testing (we encourage [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) or [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine))
